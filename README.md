# ChatMeterBot

This is a bot, created for usage with Telegram, that automatically sends a sticker 'SILENCE' after 10 minutes of inactivity, and a sticker 'RIP CHAT' after 30 minutes of activity.

Note that these intervals are not precise, so it may not correspond exactly to 10 and 30 minutes, respectively, because the polling occurs in exactly these intervals. So it is possible to a sticker to be sent between 10 and 20 minutes in the case of the 'SILENCE' sticker, and between 30 and 60 minutes in the case of the 'RIP CHAT' sticker.

You may add it to a group using it's username, [@ChatMeterBot](https://telegram.me/ChatMeterBot), note that it only works in groups and supergroups, not in the private mode (because it does not make sense to..).
